## Requirements
- Neovim
    - Install with `brew install neovim`
- A patched font (nerd font) as your terminal font
    - I'm using `FiraMono Nerd Font` from [here](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts)

## Setup
- clone this repository to `~/.config`, change the name of the directory to `nvim` so that the contents of this repo live in `~/.config/nvim`
- start neovim using the `nvim` command, the packages should all download autmatically and you'll be ready to go with the base configuration. From here you can fork/branch the repo and make any config/plugin changes you want
- (optional) alias `vim` and `vi` to `nvim` so you can use `vim` to access neovim instead of vanilla vim, which won't have this setup
